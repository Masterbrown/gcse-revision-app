It is supposed to calculate and display the highest common factor of two numbers entered by the user. The highest common factor of two numbers is the largest number that both numbers can be divided by without leaving a remainder. Examples: • the highest common factor of the numbers 6 and 9 is 3 • the highest common factor of 2 and 5 is 1 Line numbers are shown but are not part of the program code. 1 num1 = int(input()) 2 num2 = int(input()) 3 hcf = 1 4 count = 1 5 while count < num1: 6 if (num1 % count == 0 and num2 % count == 0): 7 hcf = count 8 count = count + 1 9 print(hcf) The program works correctly sometimes but not always. When the user enters the numbers 4 and 6 it correctly outputs 2, but when the user enters the numbers 4 and 4 it should output 4 but it does not.",

Your program should: • keep asking the user to enter a speed for the go-kart until they enter a speed that is between 10 and 50 (inclusive) • calculate the braking distance in metres by dividing the speed by 5 • ask the user if the ground is wet (expect the user to enter yes if it is) • if the ground is wet, multiply the braking distance by 1.5 • output the final calculated braking distance. You should use meaningful variable name(s), correct syntax and indentation in your answer. The answer grid below contains vertical lines to help you indent your code accurately.

Correct technical language is used throughout. 2 There is some description of the role of one named protocol in each 4-6 layer. Some correct technical language is used though there may be errors. 1 Statements are made about the role of one named protocol in each 1-3 layer. Little or no technical language is used or is used incorrectly. 0 No creditworthy material 0 Calday Grange Grammar School Page 14 of 39 Guidance to examiners Good description of protocol role might be: HTTPS is an extension of HTTP and allows secure transfer of data between a browser and a website by encrypting data. The web browser will check the website server’s security certificate and ensure it is legitimate. This means it’s not possible to see or eavesdrop on what you’re browsing or for your data to be stolen. Some description of protocol role might be: HTTPS allows secure transfer of data between a browser and a website by encrypting the data being transferred to stop your data being stolen. It does this by checking a security certificate to see if the website is legitimate. Statements about protocol role might be: In HTTPS the S stands for secure and stops your data being stolen on a website. It encrypts your data. Calday Grange Grammar School Page 15 of 39 Indicative content (role of protocols listed in question) HTTP Provides a way for users to interact with web resources. Transmits messages between client and server using hypertext. HTTPS As HTTP but in addition uses an encryption protocol to ensure communications are secure. SMTP Enables users to send (and receive) email messages. Initiates sessions between user and mail server. Server then forwards messages. Uses a process called ‘store and forward’ to store messages and forward as necessary. The server decides which server to send the message to and the inbox provider then downloads the message and places it in the recipient’s inbox. Often used in conjunction with IMAP. IMAP Stores email messages on an ISPs server but allows user to manipulate messages as though on a local device. Local devices access the ISP server to access the messages. IMAP works with desktop clients and webmail clients. Allows simultaneous logins from different devices to one account FTP Allows secure transfer of files between client and server. Files are uploaded to and downloaded from the server using FTP. TCP Connects network devices to the Internet. It defines how applications can create channels of communication across a network. It manages how a message is assembled into smaller packets before transmission and reassembles packets in the correct order at destination. UDP Communications protocol that establishes low latency and loss-tolerating connections between applications. Enables the transfer of data before an agreement is provided by the receiving party. This speeds up transfers. Can start transferring data before agreement is received from receiving party. IP Relays data across network boundaries. It defines how to address and route each packet to make sure it reaches the right destination.

The reasons given are clearly relevant to the context of networks in a school environment. The discussion is logically coherent and the reasons given follow a clear line of reasoning from the advantages and disadvantages of the two types of network. Level 2 (3–4 marks): A logically coherent discussion includes consideration (one or two reasons) of why schools should use a wireless network (or why they should use a wired network) and consideration (one or two reasons) of why schools should use a wired network (or why they should use a wireless network). Most of the reasons given will be clearly relevant to the context of networks in a school environment rather than being more general discussion points about the two types of network. Level 1 (1–2 marks): A statement of one or two reasons why schools either should or should not use a wireless network has been included. The reasons given may not be strongly linked to a school environment. Alternatively, a statement of one or two reasons why schools either should or should not use a wired network has been included. The reasons given may not be strongly linked to a school environment. 0 marks: No creditworthy answer Guidance – Indicative Response Schools should use wired networks: • as they need high bandwidth as they make use of a lot of multimedia; • as they need high bandwidth / reliable systems as delays in lessons are not acceptable; • there is better security on wired networks making it easier for schools to control / monitor how students are using the network; • network performance may be poor if there are large numbers of student-owned devices using the school network at any one time; Schools should use wireless networks: • as it allows students to make use of their own portable devices in their learning; • as maintaining a safe learning environment is very important as children are more vulnerable to safety issues (like trailing wires); • it allows computing devices to be used outside of the lesson eg in PE lessons; • as schools have limited budgets and it is cheaper to add extra wireless devices to a school network; • less cable and drilling needed which may save money; • as there are now many devices which don’t have wired connection ports and schools may want to be able to use these devices; [6] Calday Grange Grammar School Page 33 of 39 All marks AO1 (recall) 1 mark: a set of rules; 1 mark: that allow two devices to communicate; [2]",

The quality of written communication skills associated with each level is indicated above. Examples of advantages of connecting to a network (give credit to any other correct example): • Enables users to work from multiple physical locations; • Enables hardware resources to be shared between computers; • Enables computers to communicate with one another; • Creates more resilient systems (than when you are reliant on just one computer); • Enables processing to be distributed; • May enable access to web services; • Easier monitoring of all users; • Centralised back-up is possible; • Easier to maintain multiple devices. Examples of disadvantages of connecting to a network (give credit to any other correct example): • Additional hardware is required; • Introduces potential security risks. [allow a maximum of two points for viruses, hacking and so on]; • Additional support costs; • Certain hardware failures (e.g. main server or switch // router) could impact other devices; • Performance potentially limited by network traffic.

No creditworthy material 0 Calday Grange Grammar School Page 12 of 31 Indicative Content The indicative content below is written in a generic manner for the benefit of examiners. Responses should be worded in the context of a school to gain the highest marks. For example reference to pupils using default passwords or them gaining access to staff-only areas through misconfigured access rights. • Weak and default passwords: ○ students could use brute force methods to crack passwords ○ weak admin passwords would allow students to gain admin level access ○ default passwords allow students to gain access without any effort ○ default passwords are published online so everyone knows them. • Misconfigured access rights: ○ allows students to access areas they are not supposed to ○ network admins might not know that secure areas had been breached as no-one has ‘broken in’ ○ students could reconfigure network ○ students could create new user accounts to give themselves admin access. • Removable media: ○ could contain malware that allows students to gain access to network ○ could be used to steal data ○ could be used to allow students to take control of certain network processes (eg remote access systems). • Unpatched and/or outdated software: ○ could allow students to exploit known weakness/flaw ○ known weaknesses/flaws are published online ○ once in a student could install malware.

Answers that are too similar to each other must only be credited once. Example responses include: • Train staff/students to be cautious of emails; ○ that come from unrecognised senders; ○ that ask you to confirm personal/financial information (over the Internet); ○ that make urgent requests for personal/financial information; ○ that are not personalised; ○ that try to upset you into acting quickly by threatening you with frightening information; • Train staff/students not to click on links/download files/open attachments (in emails); from unknown senders/sources; • Prevent students from being able to download; anything from the internet/email links; • Train staff/students to never enter personal information; in a pop-up screen; • Train staff/students not to copy web addresses (into a browser); from pop-ups; • Protect the school computers with a firewall/spam filters/anti-virus/anti-spyware software; and keep the software updated; [4] 3 marks for AO1 (understanding) and 3 marks for AO2 (apply) 2 marks per method, 1 mark for stating the method, 1 mark for an explanation. • Passwords; a set of characters that is only known by the person who is being authenticated//a set of characters that is entered and compared against a database / recorded version; • Biometric; measures such as fingerprint, facial, iris, voice-print that use the user’s physical features to prove who they are; • Email confirmation; sends an email which requires a valid email address and for the recipient to respond to prove the email and hence user is valid; A. Other methods that are not in the specification that are appropriate should also be awarded marks. Examples such as 2 Factor Authentication (2FA), Authenticator Apps, security questions. [6] 4 marks for AO1 (understanding) Maximum of 3 marks if only 1 type of testing. Black box testing: • the tester does not know how the system operates; • the tester is acting as an external hacker; • requires a lot of investigation and guessing / brute-force to find issues; • may not test all of the system especially if you do not know it’s full functionality; • you are trying to discover and exploit the weak spots in the system; Calday Grange Grammar School Page 14 of 31 White box testing: • the operation of the system is known; • the tester is simulating a malicious insider; • can be targeted to test specific vulnerabilities; • you know exactly what you are trying to test; • because you know what you are testing you should be able to test all possible scenarios; R. Any direct opposites. Statements such as “Black box has no knowledge of how the system operates. White box has knowledge of how the system operates.” would be awarded only one mark. [4] 3 marks for AO1 (recall), 3 marks for AO1 (understanding) 1 mark each for stating, 1 mark each for describing. • Trojan (horse); a program which misleads the user into thinking it is another piece of software which, when run, executes another program; • Spyware; a program which records data such as usernames and passwords on a host system and forwards the information to a third party; • Adware; code embedded or attached to program files which will persistently show adverts (that attempt to generate revenue); • Worm; code which will run autonomously and replicates itself on a host system; • Ransomware; a program that encrypts user’s data to make it unreadable until they pay for the key; • Remote Access Tool (RAT); allows access to control and monitor a computer from a remote network location; • Rootkit; malware that has managed to gain ‘root’ admin privileges; • Bots / Zombies; a program installed on a computer that performs a job for the remote owner of the bot / zombie such as sending spam or sending web requests to perform a DOS or attacking a computer system; • Scareware; malware that tells you something is wrong with your system in an attempt to get you to make a purchase; • Keylogger; a program that monitors / records a user’s keystrokes in order to steal passwords / confidential details; R. Specific named examples on their own, e.g. “Wannacry” would receive no marks, “Ransomware such as Wannacry” would receive 1 mark. R. References to ‘virus’ as this is the example in the question.

There is some reference to the legal and/or ethical impacts of the 1 increased use of autonomous vehicles but the points made may not 1-2 always be clear or well-explained. No creditworthy material 0 Guidance: Ethical impacts • Trust. The driver is trusting the algorithms in the car to make the correct decisions whilst driving eg slowing down when pedestrians are in the road. • Decision making. The car must make human-like decisions when confronted with unusual circumstances eg the 'trolley problem’. • Safer driving. Autonomous vehicles could be safer drivers than human drivers eg by keeping a safe distance from the car in front at all times. • Data collection. Autonomous vehicles may collect private data about their passengers such as locations visited. Passengers may want to keep their journeys private. • Job opportunities. Fewer roles needed for some professions such as taxi drivers but other opportunities could be created. • Accessibility. Disabled passengers will not have to operate traditional car controls. Legal impacts • Liability. There is a grey area about who is at fault (the manufacturer or the driver) in case of an accident. • Insurance. The need for driving insurance will change as drivers are no longer responsible for the control of the car. • Data protection. Car manufacturers must keep driving data secure in accordance with data protection laws. • Security. Autonomous vehicles could be vulnerable to being hacked and hijacked for criminal purposes. • Law updates. Driving laws will need to be amended to account for new types of vehicles on the roads.
