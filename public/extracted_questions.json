(1) (b)  State the most suitable data type to use for the Complexity field. (1) Due to a change in layout at a games café, the game table with an ID of 2 is no longer suitable for games that can have more than four players. The manager needs to find out the customer, date and time of all bookings made for the game table with an ID of 2 that are for a game that can have more than four players. Write an SQL query that could be used to find this information for the manager. The results should be shown in date order. [6 marks]",

The company’s present focus is tagging “high-risk” patients, such as those with diabetes, heart conditions or Alzheimer’s. “People who wear identification tags and bracelets often remove them because they do not like the way they look or feel,” said Allison Tomek, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Applied Digital. “The VeriChip is the only medical device that is guaranteed to always be with you to provide your identification and medical records information in an emergency situation.” VeriChip has offered hospitals free RFID scanners to encourage use of the chips, but acceptance has been limited, and the potential risks associated with RFID may be to blame.’ Explain two potential legal and/or ethical impacts of using implanted microchips in healthcare.
